# Resume Agent Instructions

When updating the resume:
1. Read the current resume file (likely `Nicholas_Zolton_Resume.typ`) to understand the current state
2. Read `resume_info.json` to understand what information is available
3. Make targeted updates based on user requests
4. Always compile the resume after changes using `typst compile`
5. Verify the output PDF and report any compilation errors immediately
